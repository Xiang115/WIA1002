# Tuto 7 (Stack)

## Question 1:
The stack method that returns an element from the stack without removing it is ____________.
```bash
a. pop
b. push
c. peek
d. spy
```
## Solution (Q1):
```bash
Answer = c
```

## Question 2:
We have three stacks, s1, s2 and s3, that can contain data of type String. Here are their initial contents:

As you can see, initially s2 and s3 are empty. Here is a sequence of operations on the three stacks:
```bash
s2.push(s1.pop());
s3.push(s1.pop());
s1.pop();
s1.push(s2.pop());
s2.push(s3.pop());
s2.push(s1.pop());
```
Draw the contents of the three stacks after the operations are complete.

## Question 3:
Over time, the elements 1, 2, and 3 are pushed onto a stack in that order. For each of the following, 
indicate (yes or no) whether the sequence could be created by popping operations. If yes, list the 
sequence of `push()` and `pop()` operations that produces the sequence.     
```bash
(a) 1-2-3 (b) 2-3-1 (c) 3-2-1 (d) 1-3-2
```

## Solution (Q3):
(a) Yes     
```bash
stack.push(1);
stack.pop();
stack.push(2);
stack.pop();
stack.push(3);
stack.pop();
```

(b) Yes      
```bash
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.pop();
stack.push(3);
stack.pop();
stack.pop();
```

(c) Yes       
```bash
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);
stack.pop();
stack.pop();
stack.pop();
```

(d) Yes      
```bash
stack.push(1);
stack.pop();
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);
stack.pop();
stack.pop();
```

## Question 4:
Convert the following infix expressions to postfix:   
```bash
a) a + b * c
b) a * b â€“ c/d
c) a + (b*c + d)/e
```

## Solution (Q4):  
(a)
```bash
abc*+
```

(b)    
```bash
ab*cd/-
```

(c)   
```bash
abc*d+e/+
```

## Question 5:   
Write the following expressions in infix form:  
```bash
a) a b + c *
b) a b c + *
```

## Solution (Q5):
(a)   
```bash
(a + b) * c
```   

(b)   
```bash
a * (b + c)
```

## Question 6:
Which of the following is an application of stack?   
```bash
A. finding factorial
B. tower of Hanoi
C. infix to postfix
D. all of the above
```  

## Solution (Q6):
```bash
Answer = D
```
