    // What is erasure?

    // The implementation of generic where compiler erases the generic type during
    // run time
    // after using the generic information during compile time

    // Why are Java generic implements using erasure?

    // This approach enables the generic code to be backward-compatible with the
    // legacy code thatuses raw types.
