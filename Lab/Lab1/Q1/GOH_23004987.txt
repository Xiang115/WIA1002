My name is GOH KIAN XIANG with matrix number, 23004987. I am
majoring in Information Systems. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because I can learn lots of things form it.
I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will do practice until dead. Wish me luck!!!
